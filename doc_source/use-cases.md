# AWS Elemental MediaConnect use cases<a name="use-cases"></a>

This section provides simplified business use cases to help you understand different ways that you can implement AWS Elemental MediaConnect to deliver content to the AWS Cloud and beyond\. The use cases in this section are described in general terms, without the mechanics of how you would use the MediaConnect API to achieve the results that you want\.

Your MediaConnect implementation is dependent on your use case:
+ For **contribution**, use MediaConnect to ingest content from an on\-premises encoder into the AWS Cloud\. Depending on the type of content you are ingesting, you can create a transport stream flow or a CDI flow\.
+ For **distribution**, use MediaConnect to deliver content to different geographical areas\.
+ For **entitlements**, use MediaConnect to share your content with other AWS accounts\.
+ For **replication and monitoring**, use MediaConnect to distribute video to multiple destinations and enable the monitoring of multiple video signals in real time\.
