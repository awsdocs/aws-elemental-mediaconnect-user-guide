# Stream ID<a name="hp-flow-stream-id"></a>

The stream ID is set in the Zixi feeder\.

**Important**  
If you keep this field blank, MediaConnect uses the source name as the stream ID\. Because the stream ID must match the value set in the Zixi feeder exactly, you must specify the stream ID if you want to use a source name that differs from the stream ID\.
