# Flow<a name="hp-view-flow"></a>

After you create a flow, you can do the following:
+ Start and stop the flow
**Note**  
In particular, you might need to stop and restart a flow to take advantage of new features and options that have been added to MediaConnect since the flow was started\.
+ Add, update, and remove tags
+ Add a second source
+ Change any aspect of the source except the source type
+ Add, update, and remove outputs
+ Grant, update, and revoke entitlements
+ Add a VPC interface to establish a connection between your flow and a virtual private cloud \(VPC\) that you set up in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud service
