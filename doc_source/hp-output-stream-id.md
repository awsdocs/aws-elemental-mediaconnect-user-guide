# Stream ID<a name="hp-output-stream-id"></a>

Specify the stream ID set in the Zixi receiver\.

**Important**  
If you keep this field blank, MediaConnect uses the output name as the stream ID\. Because the stream ID must match the value set in the Zixi receiver exactly, you need to specify the stream ID if you want to use an output name that differs from the stream ID\.
