# Use Case: Distribution<a name="use-cases-distribution"></a>

You can use AWS Elemental MediaConnect to distribute content to different geographic regions\. 

Assume that you have an on\-premises contribution encoder in Portland, Oregon. You can set up uploads through an AWS Elemental MediaConnect cloud system in the us\-west\-1 Region, closest to Portland. You can then configure that AWS Elemental MediaConnect instance to send your content to MediaConnect systems in other regions, as depicted in the following diagram.
