You can add up to 50 outputs for each flow\. When you add an output, you specify the IP address that you want the content sent to\. Creating an output is useful if you intend to send your content to an on\-premises encoder\.

Alternatively, you can grant an entitlement to share your content with another AWS account \(subscriber account\)\. When the subscriber creates a flow using your content as the source, MediaConnect generates an output on your flow\. These outputs also count toward the 50\-output maximum on your flow\.

You can add and remove outputs at any time, even when the flow is active\.
