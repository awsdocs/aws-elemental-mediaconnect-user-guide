# Enter reservation details<a name="hp-reservation-purchase"></a>

When you purchase an offering, you are asked to provide details for what will become your reservation\. These details include:
+ A reservation name: The name is meant to help you keep track of your reservation and its purpose\. Because reservation names must be unique within your account in the current Region, consider adding details that are unique to this reservation, such as a start date or a purpose\.
+ Start date: You can choose a retroactive start date, as early as the first day of the current month\. The latest start date you can choose is today's date\. Reservations can't be purchased for a start date in the future\.
+ Start time: Specify the start time in a 24\-hour notation\. Use the following format: HH:mm:SS\. 
  + If your start date is today, the latest start time you can choose is the current time\. 
  + If your start date is any day before today, you can choose any start time you want, ranging from 12:00am \(represented by `00:00:00`\) until just before midnight \(represented by `23:59:59`\)\.
