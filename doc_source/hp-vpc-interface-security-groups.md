# VPC security groups<a name="hp-vpc-interface-security-groups"></a>

In Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(Amazon VPC\), you can add security groups to your VPC\. A security group acts as a virtual firewall for an Amazon EC2 instance within your VPC\. For each security group, you add rules that control the inbound traffic, and a separate set of rules that control the outbound traffic\. 

In MediaConnect, after you choose the VPC security groups for your VPC interface, a table appears with the inbound and outbound rules for the security groups that you chose\.
