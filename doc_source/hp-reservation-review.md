# Review and purchase<a name="hp-reservation-review"></a>

Review the details of your reservation carefully to make sure that you agree with all aspects of the reservation\.

If everything looks good, choose **Purchase**\. Your reservation is processed that same day and your billing is affected as of the start date that you specified in the reservation\. Your monthly bill will charge you for the amount of bandwidth in your reservation at the rate specified in your reservation\. If you use more outbound bandwidth than what your reservation covers, the overage is charged at the on\-demand rate\.

If you want to change any of the reservation details \(name, start, end\), choose **Previous**\. MediaConnect shows the previous screen where you can make edits before you submit\.

If you realize that you want to choose a different offer, choose **Cancel** and start the process over\.
