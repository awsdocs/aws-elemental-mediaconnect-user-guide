# Offerings<a name="hp-offerings"></a>

The offerings list shows all offerings, regardless of whether you are eligible to purchase them\. If you have an active reservation \(one that has already started, but hasn't expired yet\), you can't buy another offering\.

 The offering defines the amount of outbound bandwidth, the duration of the agreement, and the price\.

An *offering* is an offer by AWS for a discounted rate in exchange for a commitment to purchase a specific amount of outbound bandwidth over a period of time\. When you purchase an offering, you specify the start date and a name to be used for billing purposes\. The agreement of this purchase is referred to as a *reservation*\.
