# Use case: replication and monitoring for CDI flows<a name="use-cases-cdi-replication-monitoring"></a>

You can use AWS Elemental MediaConnect to replicate and distribute video to multiple destinations and monitor the multiple video signals in real time\.

For example, you can switch between multiple live events that are happening at different venues to create a single output broadcast\. Using a MediaConnect CDI workflow, you can take the outputs from multiple production switchers and send those to a master control switcher and a multiviewer application\. You can use another CDI flow to send the final output to the distribution encoder \(for example, AWS Elemental MediaLive\), and also to the multiviewer application\. The production team receives the output from the multiviewer, which enables them to monitor the multiple video signals in real time\. 

The following illustration shows how you can use MediaConnect CDI workflows to replicate and distribute video to multiple destinations\. You can create a single output broadcast from video content coming from multiple events, and also send the output from multiple signals for monitoring in real time\.

![\[This illustration shows two events happening at different venues feeding live video content into two production switchers. The production switcher applications produce outputs from each of the venues. MediaConnect CDI workflows feed that output to the master control switcher, and also to a multi-viewer application. A third MediaConnect CDI workflow sends the final output to the distribution encoder (for example, AWS Elemental MediaLive) to create a single output broadcast. It also sends a copy to the multi-viewer. The output of the multi-viewer is sent to the production team. This allows human or automated visual monitoring of all three video signals in real-time.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconnect/latest/ug/)
