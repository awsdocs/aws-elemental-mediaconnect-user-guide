# Whitelist CIDR block<a name="hp-flow-whitelist-cidr-block"></a>

The whitelist CIDR block is a range of IP addresses that should be allowed to contribute content to your source\. These IP addresses must be in the form of a Classless Inter\-Domain Routing \(CIDR\) block; for example, 10\.0\.0\.0/16\. The source needs to be in the range covered by this CIDR block\. Any IP address within this range is allowed to send content to this flow\.
