# Create flow<a name="hp-create-flow"></a>

A flow is a connection between one video source and one or more outputs\. When you first create a MediaConnect flow, you set up a source, a name, and an Availability Zone\. After you create the flow, you must complete the flow configuration by indicating where the content should be delivered\. You can add outputs to specify the destinations for your content\. You can also grant entitlements to allow other AWS account holders to use your content as the source for their flows\.

You can create multiple flows within the same AWS Region for redundancy, just by choosing different Availability Zones for each flow\.
