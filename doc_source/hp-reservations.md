# Reservations<a name="hp-reservations"></a>

A *reservation* is a pricing agreement for a discounted rate in exchange for a commitment to purchase a specific amount of outbound bandwidth each month\. The rate in your reservation applies to outbound bandwidth for all flows from your account until your account reaches the amount of bandwidth in your reservation\.

*Outbound bandwidth* refers to data that is transferred from a MediaConnect flow to a location or endpoint outside of the AWS Cloud\. It does not include data transferred in to your MediaConnect flow, nor does it include data transferred from a MediaConnect flow to any location within the AWS Cloud\. 

You purchase a reservation by selecting an offering first\. You have several offerings to choose from, each with a different rate for different amounts of outbound bandwidth\. You choose the offering that best aligns with your expected monthly usage\. Then, you specify the start date and time\. When you complete the purchasing process, MediaConnect creates a new resource in your account, called a *reservation*\.

If you want a reservation with more outbound bandwidth, contact [AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/) or your account manager\.
