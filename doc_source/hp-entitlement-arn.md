# ARN<a name="hp-entitlement-arn"></a>

The Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) is a unique identifier for AWS resources\. After you grant an entitlement, MediaConnect assigns an ARN to the entitlement\. You need to share the ARN with the subscriber, along with the AWS Region of the flow, the encryption information for the entitlement, and the data transfer percentage\.

The subscriber needs the entitlement ARN to create a flow based on the entitlement that you granted\.
