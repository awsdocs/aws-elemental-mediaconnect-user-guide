# Reservation details<a name="hp-reservation-details"></a>

Each reservation is composed of an offering, and the details that you set for the reservation\.

The *offering * is the option you chose to purchase\. AWS defines the offers, which include the amount of outbound bandwidth, the reduced billing rate, and the duration\.

The remaining reservation details include the reservation name and start date and time\. You chose this information when you purchased the offering\. The reservation name is a name that helps you manage your reservations\. You can choose any name you want\. We suggest that you follow a naming convention that makes it easy for you to tell the reservations apart\. Note that reservation names must be unique in your account within the current Region\. For this reason, you might consider including the reservation start date in the reservation name\.

Remember the reservation name must have 1\-128 characters The first and last characters must be letters \(a\-z, A\-Z\) or numbers \(0\-9\)\. All other characters must be letters numbers, dashes \(\-\), or underscores \(\_\)\.

MediaConnect sets an Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) for the reservation as a unique identifier for this resource\.
