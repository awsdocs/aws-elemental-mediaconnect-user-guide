# AWS Elemental MediaConnect metrics to monitor source health<a name="monitor-with-cloudwatch-metrics-source-health"></a>

AWS Elemental MediaConnect sends metrics to CloudWatch\. You can review specific metrics to evaluate the health of the source of your flow\. If the flow is unhealthy, these metrics can help you determine whether the issue originates with the source\. For details about each metric, see the tables in this section\.

For information about flow metrics, see [Metrics to monitor flow health](monitor-with-cloudwatch-metrics-flow-health.md)\.

**Note**  
Metrics tracked by MediaConnect adhere to the standard as defined by the TR 101 290 spec\.

## Source metrics<a name="monitor-with-cloudwatch-metrics-source-health-source"></a>

The following table lists source metrics that AWS Elemental MediaConnect sends to CloudWatch\.


| Metric | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| SourceARQRecovered |  The number of dropped packets that were recovered by automatic repeat request \(ARQ\)\. This metric applies only to sources that use the RIST protocol or the Zixi protocol\. It doesn't apply to flows that receive content from an entitlement\. Units: Count Valid dimensions:  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconnect/latest/ug/monitor-with-cloudwatch-metrics-source-health.html)  | 
| SourceARQRequests |  The number of retransmitted packets that were requested through automatic repeat request \(ARQ\) and received\. This metric applies only to sources that use the RIST protocol or the Zixi protocol\. It doesn't apply to flows that receive content from an entitlement\. Units: Count Valid dimensions:  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconnect/latest/ug/monitor-with-cloudwatch-metrics-source-health.html)  | 
| SourceBitRate |  The bitrate of the incoming \(source\) video\. Units: bits per second \(b/s\) Valid dimensions: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconnect/latest/ug/monitor-with-cloudwatch-metrics-source-health.html)  MediaConnect suppresses null packets in an effort to optimize the data connection between the content originator's flow and the subscriber's flow\. This can result in a fluctuating bitrate on the subscriber's flow, or a difference between the bitrate of the content originator's flow and the subscriberâ€™s flow\. We recommend that you monitor source health as a combination of `SourceBitRate` and other metrics such as `SourceContinuityCounter` and `SourceNotRecoveredPackets`\.   | 
| SourceConnected |  The status of the source\. A value of 1 indicates that the source is connected and a value of 0 \(zero\) indicates that the source is disconnected\.
