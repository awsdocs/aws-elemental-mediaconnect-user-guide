# Tags<a name="hp-tags"></a>

A tag is a custom attribute label that you assign or that AWS assigns to an AWS resource\. Tags help you identify and organize your AWS resources across AWS services\. For example, you could assign the same tag to a MediaConnect flow that you assign to an AWS Elemental MediaLive channel output\. You can also use tags to track your AWS costs\. You activate these tags on the AWS Billing and Cost Management dashboard\. AWS uses the tags to categorize your costs and deliver a monthly cost allocation report to you\.

Each tag has two parts:
+ A *tag key* \(for example, CostCenter, Environment, or Project\)\. Tag keys are case sensitive\.
+ An optional field known as a *tag value* \(for example, 111122223333 or Production\)\. Like tag keys, tag values are case sensitive\.
