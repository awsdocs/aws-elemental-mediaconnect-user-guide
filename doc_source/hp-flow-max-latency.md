# Maximum latency<a name="hp-flow-max-latency"></a>

Maximum latency is the size of the buffer \(delay\) that you want MediaConnect to maintain\. A higher latency value means a longer delay in transmitting the stream, but more room for error correction\. A lower latency value means a shorter delay, but less room for error correction\. You can choose a value from 1\-15,000 ms\. If you keep this field blank, the service uses the default value of 2,000 ms\.
