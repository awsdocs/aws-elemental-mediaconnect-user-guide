# Adding VPC outputs to a flow<a name="outputs-add-vpc"></a>

A VPC output goes to a virtual private cloud \(VPC\) that you created using Amazon Virtual Private Cloud\.

For transport stream flows, you can add outputs \(up to 50\) even if the flow is active\. For CDI flows, you can add outputs \(up to 10\) only if the flow is in standby mode\. For optimal performance, follow the guidance offered in [Best practices](best-practices.md)\. 

**To add a VPC output to a flow \(console\)**

1. Open the MediaConnect console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/mediaconnect/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediaconnect/)\.

1. On the **Flows** page, choose the name of the flow that you want to add an output to\.

   The details page for that flow appears\. 

1. Choose the **Outputs** tab\.

1. Choose **Add output**\.

1. For **Name**, specify a name for your output\. This value is an identifier that is visible only on the AWS Elemental MediaConnect console and is not visible to the end user\.

1. For **Output type**, choose **VPC output**\.

1. For **Protocol**, choose the appropriate protocol\.

1. For **Description**, enter a description that will remind you later where this output is going\. This might be the company name or notes about the setup\.

1. Determine which protocol you want to use for the output\. The protocol options are dependent on the flow type\.
   + For transport stream flows, the protocol options are: RTP, RTP\-FEC, RIST, SRT, and Zixi\.
   + For CDI flows, the protocol options are: CDI and ST 2110 JPEG XS\.

1. For specific instructions based on the protocol that you want to use, choose one of the following tabs:

------
#### [ RIST ]

   1. For **Protocol**, choose **RIST**\. 

   1. For **IP address**, choose the IP address where you want to send the output\.

   1. For **Port**, choose the port that you want to use when the content is distributed to this output\. For more information about ports, see [Output destinations](destinations.md)\.
**Note**  
The RIST protocol requires one additional port for error correction\. To accommodate this requirement, AWS Elemental MediaConnect reserves the port that is \+1 from the port that you specify\. For example, if you specify port 4000 for the output, the service assigns ports 4000 and 4001\.

   1. For **Smoothing latency**, specify the additional delay that you want to use with output smoothing\. We recommend that you specify a value of 0 ms to disable smoothing\. However, if the receiver can't process the stream properly, specify a value between 100 and 1,000 ms\. This way, AWS Elemental MediaConnect attempts to correct jitter from the flow source\. If you keep this field blank, the service uses the default value of 0 ms\.

   1. For **Output to VPC**, choose the name of the VPC interface that you want to send your output to\.

------
#### [ RTP or RTP\-FEC ]

   1. For **Protocol**, choose **RTP** or **RTP\-FEC**\. 

   1. For **IP address**, choose the IP address where you want to send the output\.

   1. For **Port**, choose the port that you want to use when the content is distributed to this output\. For more information about ports, see [Output destinations](destinations.md)\.
**Note**  
The RTP\-FEC protocol requires two additional ports for error correction\. To accommodate this requirement, AWS Elemental MediaConnect reserves the ports that are \+2 and \+4 from the port that you specify\. For example, if you specify port 4000 for the output, the service assigns ports 4000, 4002, and 4004\. 

   1. For **Smoothing latency**, specify the additional delay that you want to use with output smoothing\. We recommend that you specify a value of 0 ms to disable smoothing\. However, if the receiver can't process the stream properly, specify a value between 100 and 1,000 ms\. This way, AWS Elemental MediaConnect attempts to correct jitter from the flow source\. If you keep this field blank, the service uses the default value of 0 ms\.

   1. For **Output to VPC**, choose the name of the VPC interface that you want to send your output to\.

------
#### [ SRT\-listener ]

   1. For **Protocol**, choose **SRT\-listener**\. 

   1. For **Minimum latency**, specify the minimum size of the buffer \(delay\) that you want the service to maintain\. A higher latency value means a longer delay in transmitting the stream, but more room for error correction\. A lower latency value means a shorter delay, but less room for error correction\. You can choose a value from 100â€“15,000 ms\. If you keep this field blank, MediaConnect uses the default value of 2,000 ms\. 

   1. For **Port**, choose the port that you want to use when the content is distributed to this output\. For more information about ports, see [Output destinations](destinations.md)\.

   1. For **Output to VPC**, choose the name of the VPC interface that you want to send your output to\.

   1. If you want to encrypt the video as it is sent to this output, do the following:

      1. In the **Encryption** section, choose **Enable**\.

      1. For **Role ARN**, specify the ARN of the role that you created when you [set up encryption](encryption-static-key-set-up.md#encryption-static-key-set-up-create-iam-role)\.

      1. For **Secret ARN**, specify the ARN that AWS Secrets Manager assigned when you [created the secret to store the encryption key](encryption-static-key-set-up.md#encryption-static-key-set-up-store-key)\.

------
#### [ Zixi push ]

   1. For **Protocol**, choose **Zixi push**\. 

   1. For **IP address**, choose the IP address where you want to send the output\.

   1. For **Port**, choose the port that you want to use when the content is distributed to this output\. For more information about ports, see [Output destinations](destinations.md)\.

   1. For **Stream ID**, enter the stream ID that is set in the Zixi receiver\.
**Important**  
If you keep this field blank, the service uses the output name as the stream ID\. Because the stream ID must match the value set in the Zixi receiver, you must specify the stream ID if it is not exactly the same as the output name\.

   1. For **Maximum latency**, specify the size of the buffer \(delay\) that you want the service to maintain\. A higher latency value means a longer delay in transmitting the stream, but more room for error correction\. A lower latency value means a shorter delay, but less room for error correction\. You can choose a value between 0 and 60,000 ms\. If you keep this field blank, the service uses the default value of 6,000 ms\.

   1. For **Output to VPC**, choose the name of the VPC interface that you want to send your output to\.

   1. If you want to encrypt the video as it is sent to this output, do the following:

      1. In the **Encryption** section, choose **Enable**\.

      1. For **Encryption type**, choose **Static key**\.

      1. For **Role ARN**, specify the ARN of the role that you created when you [set up encryption](encryption-static-key-set-up.md#encryption-static-key-set-up-create-iam-role)\.

      1. For **Secret ARN**, specify the ARN that AWS Secrets Manager assigned when you [created the secret to store the encryption key](encryption-static-key-set-up.md#encryption-static-key-set-up-store-key)\.

      1. For **Encryption algorithm**, choose the type of encryption that you want to use to encrypt the source\.

------
#### [ CDI ]

   1. For **Protocol**, choose **CDI**\. 

   1. For **IP address**, choose the IP address where you want to send the output\.

   1. For **Port**, choose the port that you want to use when the content is distributed to this output\. For more information about ports, see [Output destinations](destinations.md)\.

   1. For **VPC interface**, choose the name of the VPC interface that you want to send your output to\.

   1. For each media stream that you want to send as part of the output, do the following:

      1. For **Media stream name**, choose the name of the media stream\. You can only add the media streams that the source on your flow uses\.

      1. For **Encoding name**, confirm the default value, which is pre\-selected based on the media stream type\.

      1. For **FMT**, specify the format type number \(sometimes referred to as *RTP payload type*\) of the media stream\. This value should be in a format that the receiver recognizes\.

------
#### [ ST 2110 JPEG XS ]

   1. For **Protocol**, choose **ST 2110 JPEG XS**\. 

   1. For **VPC interface 1**, choose one of the VPC interfaces that you want to send content to and then choose the specific IP address where you want to send the output\.

   1. For **VPC interface 2**, choose a second VPC interface that you want to send content to and then choose the specific IP address where you want to send the output\. There is no priority between VPC interfaces 1 and 2\.

   1. For each media stream that you want to send as part of the output, do the following:

      1. For **Media stream name**, choose the name of the media stream\. You can only add the media streams that the source on your flow uses\.

      1. For **Encoding name**, choose the format that was used to encode the data\.
         + For ancillary data streams, set the encoding name to **smpte291**\.
         + For audio streams, set the encoding name to **pcm**\.
         + For video, set the encoding name to **jxsv**\.

      1. For **Port**, choose the port that you want to use when the content is distributed to this output\. For more information about ports, see [Output destinations](destinations.md)\.

      1. For **Encoder profile**, choose a setting for the compression\. This property only applies if the source uses the CDI protocol\. 

      1. For **Compression factor**, specify a value that you want the service to use when calculating the compression for the output\. Valid values are floating point numbers in the range of 3\.0 to 10\.0, inclusive The bitrate of the output is calculated as follows:

         Output bitrate = \(1 / compressionFactor\) \* \(source bitrate\)

         This property only applies if the source uses the CDI protocol\.

   1. Choose **Add output**\.
